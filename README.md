# Wohnungsrechner

# Introduction 
With this tool you can calculate the individual rooms of your apartment and the total size of your apartment in square meters. This was an exercise in my school. 

# Current Status
At the moment the calculation is only possible in the console and with rectangular rooms without roof slope. An extension is being worked on. The supported language is german.

# Build and Test
Open the code in an IDE that supports python.
